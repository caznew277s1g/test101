Brandwatch automation tech test

## What is this?
I had a few drinks last night.
I needed to create some basic automated tests for ensuring I can always get hold of Marmite.
To be honest I'm not sure what I was thinking, I just really wanted some Marmite.
 
## What needs to be done?
Well I started writing it all out, then I had a great idea, page object!
I didn't get round to finishing it, I made toast (without Marmite).
The code is incomplete and it needs a clean up.
I have written some automated tests that are in an incomplete state.
Not only that but the code is partially refactored to use page objects.

## What are you going on about?!
This is an opportunity to showcase your skill set.
Take a look at the code, at where it can be completed and what can be improved.
Feel free to refactor the code in any way you feel necessary.
If you have a pattern that would work better,
or a better way to ensure that I get my Marmite,
you have the freedom to change this code any way you see fit.

## Where should I start?
If you are not sure where to start, I have written 3 tests that are green,
but I didn't write the code for the last 2, these need to be completed.

## What is required?
Once your changes have been completed and submitted the code must:

- Have documentation for setup and running tests
- Run out of the box (including dependencies)
- Ensure all tests pass successfully

## Any other tips?
The main areas we will be looking at are:

- The completion of the missing tests
- The coverage of the tests
- Quality and style of code used

## What is your fixation with Marmite?
I just like Marmite is all...
